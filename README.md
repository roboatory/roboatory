### Hey there, I'm Rohit ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ“š I'm currently a graduate student in biomedical data science @ Stanford
- ðŸŽ“ I previously graduated from Vanderbilt where I studied molecular & cellular biology, computer science, and mathematics, kickstarting my fascination with all three disciplines and their intersection
- ðŸ§¬ On the molecular front, I'm particularly interested in understanding the tumor microenvironment at single-cell & sub-cellular resolution using high-throughput and multimodal approaches
- ðŸ©º On the clinical front, I'm fascinated by notions of a [generalist medical AI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05881-4) to streamline healthcare delivery
