### hey there, i'm rohit ðŸ‘‹

* ðŸ“š i'm currently a graduate student in biomedical data science @ stanford and will be starting my md/phd @ penn in statistics & data science as part of their medical scientist training program
* ðŸŽ“ i previously graduated from vanderbilt where i majored in molecular & cellular biology, computer science, and mathematics, kickstarting my fascination with data-driven biological discovery and single-cell / spatial technologies
* ðŸ§  my research interests can be broadly divided along molecular, clinical, and computational fronts
  * **molecularly**, i'm interested in understanding pan-cancer tumor microenvironment progression at single-cell & spatial resolution using high-throughput and multimodal approaches
  * **clinically**, i'm fascinated by notions of a [generalist medical AI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05881-4) to streamline healthcare delivery
  * **computationally**, i'm focused on developing statistical methods and crafting deep learning approaches to enable scalable, interpretable analyses of high-dimensional single-cell and spatial datasets, with the ultimate goal of advancing the [AI virtual cell](https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0092-8674%2824%2901332-1)
